AtliQ Hardware is a global supplier of computer peripherals. While they initially performed well, they have faced significant losses in recent years. This is primarily due to their reliance on static Excel reports, which did not provide the insights needed for informed decision-making. Consequently, they've brought in a data analytics team to develop a dynamic Power BI dashboard that serves as a multifunctional tool with insights from various departments (Finance, Sales, Marketing and Supply Chain).
